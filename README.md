Modeling code for PRE paper "Links strength regulates correlations between stereocilium-deflection fluctuations"

The code has been developed using Mathematica 13.0.

The functions used to calculate the power spectra and the coherency and their derivation can be found in the paper.

The code is subdived into different sections. Each sections corresponds to a figure in the paper. Each section can be run on its own after running the first section that defines the parameters, the functions and the plot settings.
